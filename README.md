# SimVirtualLocation

Easy to use MacOS 11+ application for easy mocking iOS device and simulator location in realtime. Built on top of  [set-simulator-location](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/set-simulator-location) for iOS Simulators and [pymobiledevice3](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3). Android support is realized with [SimVirtualLocation](https://github.com/nexron171/android-mock-location-for-development) android app which is fork from [android-mock-location-for-development](https://github.com/amotzte/android-mock-location-for-development).

Posibilities:
- supports both iOS and Android
- set location to current Mac's location
- set location to point on map
- make route between two points and simulate moving with desired speed

You can dowload compiled and signed app [here](https://github.com/nexron171/SimVirtualLocation/releases).

## FAQ
---
### How to run
If you see an alert with warning that app is corrupted and Apple can not check the developer: try to press and hold `ctrl`, then click on SimVirtualLocation.app and select "Open", release `ctrl`. Now alert should have the "Open" button. Don't forget to copy app from dmg image to any place on your Mac.

### For iOS devices
`python3` and `pymobiledevice3` are should be installed

```shell
brew install python3 && python3 -m pip install -U pymobiledevice3
```

For iOS Device - select device from dropdown and then click on Mound Developer Image. If you see an error that there is no appropriate image - download one from https://github.com/mspvirajpatel/Xcode_Developer_Disk_Images/releases if your iOS for example 16.5.1 and there is only 16.5 - it's ok, just copy and rename it to 16.5.1 and put it inside Xcode at `.../Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/`

For iOS 17+ select checkbox iOS 17+ and provide RSD Address and RSD Port from command:
```shell
sudo python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote start-tunnel
```
It needs sudo, because it will instantiate low level connection between Mac and iPhone. Keep this command running while mocking location for iOS 17+.

### If iOS device is unlisted

Try to refresh list and if it does not help - go to Settings / Developer on iPhone and click Clear trusted computers. Replug cable and press refresh. If it still not in list - go to Xcode / Devices and simulators and check your device, there are should not be any yellow messages. If it has - make all that it requires.

### For Android
1. Check if debugging over USB is enabled
1. Specify ADB path (for example `/User/dev/android/tools/adb`)
1. Specify your device id (type `adb devices` in the terminal to see id)
1. Setup helper app by clicking `Install Helper App` and open it on the phone
1. Grant permission to mock location - go to Developer settings and find `Application for mocking locations` or something similar and choose SimVirtualLocation
1. Keep SimVirtualLocation running in background while mocking
